### VID/PID

Currently, USB VID/PID pair in this repo are dummy.

I am planning to apply for a reservation for the PID which is temporarily set to pidcode, but they have not yet been approved yet.

Even if the PID of this Repository is accepted from [pid.codes](http://pid.codes/), these are impossible to use in another product.
